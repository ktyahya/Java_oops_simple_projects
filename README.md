# üìö Java OOP Practice Projects  

This repository contains simple Java projects I built while learning **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts. Each project demonstrates **Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism** in practice.

## üöÄ Projects  

### 1. **Library Management System**  
- Console-based program to add and display books.  
- **OOP Concepts:**  
  - `Book` (abstract class) with `FictionBook` and `ScienceBook` subclasses.  
  - **Encapsulation** with private fields & getters.  
  - **Polymorphism** via `getBookDetails()` method overriding.  
- **Features:**  
  - Add Fiction or Science books.  
  - View all stored books.

### 2. **Cab Booking System**  
- Console-based cab booking and fare calculation app.  
- **OOP Concepts:**  
  - Abstract `Cab` class with overridden `calculateFare()` in child classes.  
  - **Inheritance** for Mini, Sedan, and Luxury cab types.  
  - **Encapsulation** for driver details & base fares.  
- **Features:**  
  - Choose cab type.  
  - Enter distance.  
  - View fare breakdown with driver details.
